Lebanon and the Lebanese people have witnessed a lot of problems and challenges during the past year. From the economic crisis that resulted in an inflation rate of approximately 400% to the Beirut explosion on August 4 that left hundreds of Lebanese families homeless, harmed a lot of small businesses, and killed approximately 200 people. Not to mention the global pandemic and the spread of COVID-19 virus that had furthermore worsened our economy, closed many small and independent businesses, and increased unemployment.

These events have left many people below poverty line unable to fulfill their basic needs. Donations and aids are the only reason keeping these people alive and in a fair shape.

During these events we noticed that a lot of people who have fallen victims to this crisis and are unable to find or seek help. Moreover, we noticed that people who are willing to help and donate are unable to do so because they do not know where to start.  
 
That is why, in this project we design a Telegram Bot. The purpose of this telegram bot is to use a large platform like Telegram to help people in need find and ask for donations. This telegram bot also allows people, NGOs, and volunteers who are willing to donate to find and communicate with people in need.
